# Deep Learning 2 Assignments

This repository contains the solutions to two assignments focused on deep learning concepts. The first assignment covers K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks. The second assignment explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the effects of different CNN parameters. Both assignments also analyze the impact of hyperparameters on model performance.

## Assignment 1: KNN, SVM, and Neural Network

The first assignment aims to familiarize you with three fundamental supervised learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.

### Tasks

1. Implement and evaluate KNN: I will implement the KNN algorithm from scratch and evaluate its performance on a given dataset. I should experiment with different values of the hyperparameter 'k' to observe its effect on accuracy.

2. Implement and evaluate SVM: I will implement an SVM classifier using a library or framework of your choice (e.g., scikit-learn) and evaluate its performance on a given dataset. Experiment with different values of the hyperparameter 'C' (regularization parameter) and observe its impact on the decision boundary and accuracy.

3. Implement and evaluate Neural Network: I will implement a simple neural network using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Train the network on a provided dataset and examine the effect of different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers.

## Assignment 2: CNN and CNN Parameters

The second assignment focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and investigates the impact of different CNN parameters on model performance.

### Tasks

1. Implement and evaluate a CNN: I will implement a CNN using a deep learning framework of your choice and evaluate its performance on a given dataset. Experiment with different architectural choices such as the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Observe the effect of these choices on model accuracy and training time.

2. Analyze the effect of CNN parameters: I will explore the effects of various CNN parameters on model performance. These parameters may include kernel size, stride, padding, activation functions, regularization techniques (e.g., dropout), and optimizer choices. Conduct experiments by varying these parameters and carefully analyze the impact on model accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization.
